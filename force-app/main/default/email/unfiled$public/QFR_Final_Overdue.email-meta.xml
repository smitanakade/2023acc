OVERDUE FINAL NOTICE
Non-Submission of the {!Case.Reporting_Period_Quarterly__c} Quarterly Financial Report

Dear Approved Provider

I am writing to Snowy Valleys Council (you) as you have not submitted your Quarterly Financial
Report (‘QFR’) for Quarter 1 2022/23, which was due on {!Case.Reporting_Due_Date__c}.

Section 63-1(1)(m) of the Aged Care Act 1997 (‘the Act’) and Part 4A of the Accountability
Principles 2014 (‘the Principles’) set out the QFR requirements which require approved
providers to prepare a QFR for each financial quarter and submit this to the Secretary of the
Department of Health and Aged Care (‘the Secretary’). Failure to lodge a QFR is a breach of
your approved provider responsibilities set out under section 43 of the Principles.

You should note that any breach of your responsibilities under the Act or Principles may result
in a delegate of the Commissioner considering taking regulatory action including by issuing a
Non-Compliance Notice or imposing one or more sanctions under section 63N of the Aged
Care Quality and Safety Commission Act 2018. Nothing in this letter limits the Commission’s
capacity to take future compliance action.

Next Steps
You must take all necessary actions to submit your QFR as a matter of urgency.
QFRs must be submitted via the portal on the Forms Administration webpage. Should you
require assistance, please contact:
• FFBCONSULTATION@health.gov.au for general QFR enquiries
• health@formsadministration.com.au if you are having difficulties accessing or using
the website or completing an online form

Yours sincerely,



Elly Osborne
