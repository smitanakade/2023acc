    <textOnly>Dear {!Case.Provider_Name__c},


RE: Quarterly Financial Report for {!Case.NAPSID__c} {!Case.Account}

We are sending this email because you have not yet submitted your Quarterly Financial Report (QFR) for the period ending {!Case.Reporting_Period_End_Date__c}. The due date for the QFR is in 5 days ({!Case.Reporting_Due_Date__c}), please submit your QFR by this date. Late submissions will result in care minutes data not being accepted for Star Rating purposes and potential regulatory action.

If you have already submitted your QFR and have received confirmation, please ignore this email.
