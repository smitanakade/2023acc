Non-Submission of the REPORTING_PERIOD Quarterly Financial Report



Dear Approved Provider



I am writing to {PROVIDER_NAME}(you) as you have not submitted your Quarterly Financial Report (‘QFR’) for REPORTING_QUARTER, which was due on REPORTING_DUEDATE.



Section 63-1(1)(m) of the Aged Care Act 1997 (‘the Act’) and Part 4A of the Accountability Principles 2014 (‘the Principles&apos;) set out the QFR requirements which requires approved providers to prepare a QFR for each financial quarter and submit this to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Aged Care (&apos;the Secretary&apos;). Failure to lodge a QFR is a breach of your approved provider responsibilities set out under section 43 of the Principles.


You should note that that any breach of your responsibilities under the Act or Principles may result in a delegate of the Commissioner considering taking regulatory action including by issuing a Non-Compliance Notice or imposing one of more sanctions under section 63N of the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission Act 2018. Noting in this letter limits the Commission&apos;s capacity to take future compliance action.


Next Steps



You must take all necessary actions to submit your QFR as a matter of urgency.


QFRs must be submitted via the portal on the Forms Administration webpage.  Should you require assistance, please contact:

· FFBCONSULTATION@health.gov.au for general QFR enquiries

· health@formsadministration.com.au if you are having difficulties accessing or using the website or completing an online form
